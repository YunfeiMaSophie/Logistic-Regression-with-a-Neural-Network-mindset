# Logistic-Regression-with-a-Neural-Network-mindset
A logistic regression classfier to recognize cats.

- Built the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including:     
    - Initializing parameters     
    - Calculating the cost function and its gradient     
    - Using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent)  
- Gathered all three functions above into a main model function, in the right order.
